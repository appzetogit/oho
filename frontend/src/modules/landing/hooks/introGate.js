/**
 * One-shot gate between the intro curtain and the hero animation.

 * The hero timeline must not build its hidden state until the curtain is
 * actually about to lift, otherwise a curtain that never finishes would leave the
 * hero invisible behind it. Everything that waits on the intro goes through
 * `onIntro`, and `markIntroDone` is called unconditionally — including from the
 * preloader's own hard timeout — so the gate always opens.
